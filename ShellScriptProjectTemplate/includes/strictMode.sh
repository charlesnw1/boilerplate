function strictMode()

# This is a function I include and execute in every shell script that I write. 
# It sets up a bunch of error handling odds and ends

#Here's the beef (as the commercial says..)

#use errexit (a.k.a. set -e) to make your script exit when a command fails.
#add || true to commands that you allow to fail.
set -o errexit

# Use set -o nounset (a.k.a. set -u) to exit when your script tries to use undeclared 
# variables.
set -o nounset

#Use set -o pipefail in scripts to catch (for example) mysqldump fails 
#in e.g. mysqldump |gzip. 
#The exit status of the last command that threw a non-zero exit code is returned
set -o pipefail
